## Core Concept
This framework uses a modular 4×3 approach (12 core slides) with 4 interchangeable slide modules. Each module contains 4 slides that can be swapped in or out based on audience needs, creating a dynamic presentation system while maintaining quattro balance.

*Note: Title and closing slides are excluded from the quattro structure per requirements*

## Modular Structure Overview

### 4 Core Modules (3 slides each = 12 slides)
1. **Impact Module** - Problem definition and market relevance
2. **Solution Module** - Technical approach and capabilities
3. **Business Module** - Financial model and market opportunity
4. **Execution Module** - Implementation plan and validation evidence

### 4 Modular Swap Sets (choose any for targeted presentations)
1. **Technical Deep Dive Set** - Advanced technical specifications
2. **Investor Relations Set** - Detailed funding and returns analysis
3. **Customer Journey Set** - User-focused solution narrative
4. **Strategic Partnership Set** - Integration and ecosystem focus

## Implementation Guidelines

### Modular Usage Rules
1. Maintain the core 4×3 structure (12 slides)
2. Select any additional 4-slide set based on audience needs
3. Any 4-slide set can replace any core module when appropriate
4. Maximum recommended presentation length: 4 modules × 4 slides = 16 slides

### Visual Consistency
- 4-color primary palette
- 4-shape visual language system
- 4 consistent transition types
- 4 recurring layout templates:
  - 2×2 quadrant
  - 4-column comparison
  - 4-step process
  - 4-element showcase
  
### Content Density
- Maximum 44 words per slide (4 sections × 11 words)
- 4 visualization types (charts, diagrams, photos, icons)
- 4-second rule for audience comprehension
- 4 bullets maximum per text block

### Modular Slide Numbering System
Format: M.S where:
- M = Module number (1-4)
- S = Slide position within module (1-4)

Example: Slide 2.3 = Solution Module, third slide
